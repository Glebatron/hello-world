# hello-world

Hello my fellow web gremlins,

My name is Gleb, and I oringinally hail from the land of Russia. I lived there until the tender age of nine, when my mother and I immigrated to the United States.

I've honestly had a great dislike for programming, however I now realize that is mostly due to my first programming teacher who was a very cantankerous man. He never explained things well, and was equally disliked by all students.

Dispite my initial dislike of coding, I now find it quite fun and exciting thanks to wonderful online learning resources.

Kindest regards,
Gleb
